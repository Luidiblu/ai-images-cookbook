Dall-E has not explicitly been "taught" anything, like who Frida Kahlo is, or what a llama looks like, or what a wide-angle lens does.

It has just studies **~650 million** images & captions, and left to draw its own conclusions.

That's why there can't be a regular "manual", based on functionality that the developers intentionally programmed in. Even the creators of Dall-E cannot be sure what Dall-E has or hasn't "learned", or what is thinks different phrases mean.

Instead, we have to "discover" what Dall-E is capable of, and how it reacts. This Cookbook is a start!
