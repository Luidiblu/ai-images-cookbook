# What is a prompt?

A prompt is a sentence of 400 characters of less, that describes the image you want.

Here are some random examples:

Dall-E has not explicitly been "taught" anything, like who Frida Kahlo is, or what a llama looks like, or what a wide-angle lens does.

It has just studies **~650 million** images & captions, and left to draw its own conclusions.

That's why there can't be a regular "manual", based on functionality that the developers intentionally programmed in. Even the creators of Dall-E cannot be sure what Dall-E has or hasn't "learned", or what is thinks different phrases mean.

Instead, we have to "discover" what Dall-E is capable of, and how it reacts. This Cookbook is a start!

# Prompt Design

**Sometimes, less is more.** Prompts can't be more than 400 characters, in any case. And you can get amazing results from just a few emojis. But if you have a specific outcome in mind, then being specific in your prompt *will* help.

<br>

A simple adjective, like "action photography", already embodies a lot of characteristics (about shutter speed, framing, lens, choices, etc) that you might otherwise define separately,

<br>

There are "finger-crossed" prompt phrases, like AI-era prayers, hoped to mean "make it really good!", such as *4k*, *8k*, *high-quality*, *trending*, *award-winning*, *acclaimed*, *on artstation,* *etc*. However, the precise impact of these has not been rigorously tested. But feel free to add them!

<br>

In text AI models, simple prompts tweaks have created huge boosts in performance: for instance, when a text generator is made to answer a math puzzle, [starting with the words "Let's think things through step-by-step' makes it 4x more likely to get the right answer."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)

<br>

So no doubt, there are similar Dall-E hacks yet to be found...

<br>

You can borrow some photographic prompt terminology (especially for framing) to apply to illustrations: e.g: "*close-up*"

<br>

If you are generating mockups of 3D art, you can also define how that piece is photographed!

<br>

Adjectives can easily influence multiple factors, e.g: "*art deco*" will influence the illustration style, but also the clothing and materials of the subject, unless otherwise defined. Years, decades and eras, like "*1924*" or "*late-90s*", can also have this effect.

<br>

Even superficially specific prompts have more "*general*" effects. For instance, defining a camera or lens ("*Sigma 75mm*") doesn't just "create that specific look", it more broadly alludes to "the kind of photo where the lens/camera appears in the description", which tend to be professional and hence higher-quality.

<br>

If a style is proving elusive, try "doubling down" with related terms (artists, years, media, movement) years, e.g: rather than simply "‚Ä¶by Picasso", try "‚Ä¶Cubist painting by Pablo Picasso, 1934, colourful, geometric work of Cubism, in the style of "Two Girls Reading." Or try [unbundling](https://bakztfuture.substack.com/p/dall-e-2-unbundling)!

<br>

Detailed prompts are great if you know exactly what you're looking for and are trying to get a specific effect.

<br>

...but Dall-E also has a creative eye, and has studied over **600 million images**. So there is *nothing* wrong with beign vague, and seeing what happens! You can also use variations to create further riffs of your favourite output. Sometimes you'll end up on quite a journey!

<br>

Putting together this document has been quite an undertaking, as it aims to cover all 16777216¬π‚Å∞‚Å¥‚Å∏‚Åµ‚Å∑‚Å∂ possible Dall-E images (vs the 10‚Å∏‚Å∞ atoms in the universe) and all possible subjects of images, which is to say, all possible *subjects* of images, which is to say, all possible objects and materials in existence, depicted in all known methods.

<br>

For 2D art, we've gone a little deeper, looking at particular art styles and art movements. But if you want to create images of buildings, for example, then learning more about architectural periods, famous architects, and names of architectural details will be helpful to create specific outputs. Same for candlesticks, cartoons or candy wrappers.

<br>

**DALL¬∑E knows a lot about everything, so the deeper your knowledge of the requisite jargon, the more detailed the results.**
